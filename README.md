# Streamlit Face Detector  

A simple Streamlit app for detecting faces in uploaded images using OpenCVâ€™s Viola-Jones (Haar Cascade) algorithm.  

The app allows users to:  
- Upload an image and detect faces.  
- Adjust detection parameters (`scaleFactor` and `minNeighbors`).  
- Choose the rectangle color around detected faces.  
- Save and download the processed image.
